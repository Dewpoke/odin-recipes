        <h6>Vegetable soup by Buckwheat Queen</h6>
        <p>
            This vegetable soup recipe from Adam Ragusea follows the age old technique of taking whatever ingredients you have, throwing them in boiling water,
            and then eating it.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pot of water</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Any vegetable. Maybe something green to make it look nice.</li>
            <li>Well any vegetable you think is good</li>
            <li>White wine</li>
            <li>Frozen peas</li>
            <li>Clove of garlic</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Basic seasoning (or whater you like)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water in a pot. Protip: start with less water rather than too much as it is easy to add more water, but hard to take out water.</li>
            <li>Cut carrots and onions and throw them in the pot, as well as other 'hard' vegetables you have choses such as potatoes.</li>
            <li>Stir the pot occasionally. Repeat this step whenever you feel like stirring the pot.</li>
            <li>Cut tomatoes into random chunks and toss them in the pot.</li>
            <li>Do the same with your other vegetables.</li>
            <li>Pour in a bunch of wine.</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove when you are happy with the softness of the soup, or are hungry.</li>
            <li>Throw in frozen peas to add greens and help cool off the soup.</li>
            <li>Crush the clove of garlic and toss it in the pot.</li>
            <li>Place soup in bowl and add a dash of olive oil and seasoning before serving.</li>
        </ol>
